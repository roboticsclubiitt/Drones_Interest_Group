## What we did extra:

We lacked a PPM-based transmitter and receiver (PWM based was available), but Pixhawk takes input only in PPM, so we made a PWM to PPM encoder using Arduino for this project.

Also, for testing and calibrating the Kp, Kd and Ki for the stability of drones, we created a makeshift testbench in this project.
