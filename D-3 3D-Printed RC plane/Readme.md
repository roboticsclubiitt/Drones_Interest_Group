# 3D-Printed RC plane

In this project, we tried to make the entire body of an RC plane using 3D printed parts which will be completely designed by us.

## Engineering Description:


The parts are printed using ABS material.

The wing was printed in three parts, joined together by resin-based glue, and supported by bicycle spokes and plastic rods running through it. Later the joints were covered with packing tape for a smoother surface so as to get a turbulence free flow of air.

Similarly, the fuselage too was multi-part and was joined using a similar process.

Wing and Fusalarge were joined together at a calculated spot, and wings were given a certain angle of attack with respect to the fuselage based on our research.

In design, it was made sure to give ample access points to reach the electronics inside of the plane.

The landing gear structure is made from Aluminium, and the wheels are of plastic. The design is such that the maximum of weight is distributed on a large area.

The motor used is a normal drone 1000kV brushless motor powered by a 30A ESC, which was attached to a 10-inch drone propeller. A nose cap covered the motor and helped in aerodynamics.

The control surfaces like ailerons, horizontal stabilizers and rudders are actuated by 9g Servos.

Everything is controlled via a 6-channel Fly-sky transmitter.

Tail and Horizontal stabilizers are made out of MDF board due to their thin nature.

## Issues we found out while testing:

- Landing gears weren't aligned straight, due to which the plane wandered off during takeoff.
- Due to bigger propellers (10 inches), the front landing gear structure was long, and since the CG of the plane was below the wings, the plane was unstable while takeoff.
- The weight of the plane was on the higher end; hence takeoff required a longer runway for higher takeoff speed. A higher thrust-generating motor could have been beneficial.
- The nose cap should have some ventilation
- Launch by hand(Catapult) is very difficult to achieve due to weight
